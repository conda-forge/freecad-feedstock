    summary: 'FreeCAD is a parametric 3D modeler made primarily to design real-life objects of any size. '
    description: |
        FreeCAD is a general purpose feature-based, parametric 3D modeler for
        CAD, MCAD, CAx, CAE and PLM, aimed directly at mechanical engineering
        and product design but also fits a wider range of uses in engineering,
        such as architecture or other engineering specialties. It is 100% Open
        Source (LGPL2+ license) and extremely modular, allowing for very
        advanced extension and customization.
        FreeCAD is based on OpenCASCADE, a powerful geometry kernel, features an
        Open Inventor-compliant 3D scene representation model provided by the
        Coin 3D library, and a broad Python API. The interface is built with Qt.
        FreeCAD runs exactly the same way on Windows, Mac OSX, BSD and Linux
        platforms.
